## Features

- [x] Parsing GPX files into a track struct
- [x] Exporting a track to a GPX xml
- [x] Support for iOS, macOS & watchOS
- [x] Optionally removes date and time from exported GPX for keeping privacy
- [x] Combine support
- [x] Height Map, geo-bounds, distance, and elevation information for an imported track
- [x] Waypoint support
- [x] Test coverage
- [x] Climb detection
- [x] Grade segmentation
- [x] Support for Garmin trackpoint extensions
- [x] Support for multiple track segements

## Installation

To use the `GPXKit` library in a SwiftPM project, add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/mmllr/GPXKit", from: "2.3.0")
```

## Usage examples

### Importing a track

```swift
import GPXKit

let parser = GPXFileParser(xmlString: xml)
    switch parser.parse() {
    case .success(let track):
        doSomethingWith(track)
    case .failure(let error):
        parseError = error
    }
...
func doSomethingWith(_ track: GPXTrack) {
    let formatter = MeasurementFormatter()
    formatter.unitStyle = .short
    formatter.unitOptions = .naturalScale
    formatter.numberFormatter.maximumFractionDigits = 1
    let trackGraph = track.graph
    print("Track length: \(formatter.string(from: Measurement<UnitLength>(value: trackGraph.distance, unit: .meters)))")
    print("Track elevation: \(formatter.string(from: Measurement<UnitLength>(value: trackGraph.elevationGain, unit: .meters)))")

    for point in track.trackPoints {
        print("Lat: \(point.coordinate.latitude), lon: \(point.coordinate.longitude)")
    }
}
```

### Exporting a track

```swift
import GPXKit
let track: GPXTrack = ...
let exporter = GPXExporter(track: track, shouldExportDate: false)
print(exporter.xmlString)
```

### Combine integration

```swift
import Combine
import GPXKit

let url = /// url with gpx
GPXFileParser.load(from: url)
   .publisher
   .map { track in
      // do something with parsed track
   }
```

See tests for more usage examples.

### Climb detection

To detect climbs in a track, use the `TrackGraph`s `climb(epsilon:minimumGrade:maxJoinDistance:)` method which returns an array of `Climb` values for given filter parameters.

```swift
let track: GPXTrack = ...
let climbs = track.graph.climbs(epsilon: 4.0, minimumGrade: 3.0, maxJoinDistance: 0.0)
// climbs is an array of `Climb` values, describing each climb (start, end, elevation, grade, FIETS score and so on...).
```
