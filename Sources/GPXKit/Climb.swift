    /// was developed by the Dutch cycling magazine Fiets. The formula is shown below:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// FIETS Score = (H * H / D * 10) + (T - 1000) / 1000
    /// ```
    /// Where:

    /// * **H** is the height of the climb (meters),
    /// * **D** is the climb length or distance (meters)
    /// * **T** is the altitude at the top (meters).

    /// The second term in the formula is only added when it is positive, that is, for climbs whose top is above 1000m.
    /// **NOTE** In GPXKit, the "(T - 1000)/1000" term of the FIETS formula is not added to the climb segments, so climbs can be joined
    /// together.
